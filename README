### Welcome to Stripe Invoice Template
This a super simple PHP invoice template for a Stripe invoice object built using Twitter's Bootstrap. 

### Configure 
Change the following variable to match your Stripe account keys.
$stripeKey = "{PRIVATE_KEY}";

I had $invoiceID hard coded for a sample you should change this value to meet your needs.

$invoiceID = 'in_123456789';

i.e $invoiceID = $_GET["id"] if you want a url like http://www.xyz.com/invoice.php?id=in_123456789
